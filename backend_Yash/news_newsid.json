        "A four-year-old elephant, which fell into a 40-feet-deep well in the early hours of Monday at Puliyangudi near Sankarankovil in Tirunelveli district was rescued by forest department officials. Personnel from the fire and rescue services department, wildlife enthusiasts, veterinarians and farmers chipped in with the rescue efforts. The male elephant was first noticed by V Gurusamy, a farmer of Puliyangudi, around 8am when he heard some strange noise from the well in his farmland. When he went to take a closer look he saw the elephant.",
        "Sankarankovil forest ranger D Ayub Khan, who headed the rescue operation, said they reached the spot with 30 forest department personnel, five fire and rescue personnel and two veterinarians. “The pachyderm did not suffer injuries as the well had a diameter of 15 feet and also had water for a depth of 15 feet,” he told TOI.",
        "The team first tried to lift the animal weighing a few quintals using soft ropes, but in vain. By then the animal had been swimming for a few hours and was tired. Metal pipes were gently dropped into the well to give some support for the calf to clingon. An earthmover was brought and a ramp was dug on the side of the well. Since the calf was tired, ropes were used to drag the animal for a few feet on to the ramp. The animal then climbed its way out and ran into the forest."
